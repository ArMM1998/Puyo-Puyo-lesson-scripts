# Puyo-Puyo-lesson-scripts
Documentation and experiments of the scripts found in various puyo games.

Check the [wiki](https://github.com/ArMM1998/Puyo-Puyo-lesson-scripts/wiki) for documentation


# Examples
There's a folder called Examples, it contains scripts i have built.
If you want to put these scripts into your game and run them, change the file name to whatever lesson you want to replace and place them into `Puyo Puyo Champions\gameAsset\steam\gameAsset\script\lesson\try`
For example, "try00000.pss" accounts for the very first "problem"

If you want to edit any of these scripts, simply open the .pss file on any text editor.
